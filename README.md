# fop-final-project
This repository is an university project for a subject called Fundamentals of Programming (FOP in short).
The team consists of me, Giorgi Siradze, Anna Narmania, Nini Phkhakadze and Tatia Tkeshelashvili.
I am a pseudo team leader, with only added responsibilities being that 
I own this repo and that I have to "remind mates that they need to do their duties" (IMUSHAVET).
